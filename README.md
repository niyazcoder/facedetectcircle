# Real-Time Face Detection Using OpenCV

## Overview

This Python project demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV’s pre-trained Haar cascade classifiers. The application accesses the webcam, detects faces in the video stream, and highlights them with bounding boxes.

---

## Features

- Real-time face detection with webcam video feed
- Uses OpenCV’s Haar cascade for face detection (no training required)
- Highlights detected faces with rectangles on the video frame
- Lightweight and easy-to-understand implementation

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (Computer Vision Library)

---

## Why This Project?

Face detection is fundamental in many computer vision applications like security, user authentication, and human-computer interaction. This project showcases skills in:

- Working with real-time video input
- Applying classical computer vision algorithms
- Building efficient, clean, and functional Python scripts
